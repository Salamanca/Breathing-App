# Breathing App
iOS App that helps you breath properly.

I created this iOS app in my Intro to iOS Develepmont class at Hunter College.
I am not a professional develepor but love creating and coming up with ideas.

The idea of this app is very simple. 
This app helps you focus on your breathing while also recording your breathing time to better track everything.

An example of the app can be preview in the repo.
